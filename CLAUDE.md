# THE GLORIFIED BODY (the game): read first

A tank-control horror game in Unity 6, a refinement of Galerians (PS1, 1999). Lucy, a young adult woman with no
memory and three psychic powers, escapes the cult's lab. Started 2026-10-20 (the pivot from the video series).

- **Design (CANON):** `/home/pc/MEGA/code/reality-fabricator/the-glorified-body/03_GAME_DESIGN.md`.
- **World and story:** `/home/pc/MEGA/code/reality-fabricator/the-glorified-body/01_SERIES_BIBLE.md`.
- **Art rules, read before any art work:** `ART_LESSONS.md` (this folder).
- **Asset lessons, full detail:** `/home/pc/MEGA/code/reality-fabricator/the-glorified-body/tests/T15_3d_set/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.
- **Agents:** `glorified-body-game` builds the game, `glorified-body-writer` writes the story, the cutscenes, the
  barks and the devlog scripts. Bruno decides.

## State

- 2026-10-20: steps 1, 2 and 3 done. Step 1: the project at the repo root (public GitHub repo, GPL-3.0), the
  menu loop and the batch harness. Step 2: tank controls with a dodge, fixed cameras per room, auto-lock with a
  target switch. Step 3: the circle charge with BLAST, FIRE and TELEKINESIS, the HP / NALCON / SHORT bars, the
  short, the drugs, a capsule dummy shooter with the canon telegraph, the greybox HUD. Lucy is still a capsule.
  Proof: 27 EditMode tests, 35 PlayMode tests, the bot (21 steps), see `devlog-notes/`. Adjustments after Bruno's
  first play (2026-10-20): the dodge is directional (Space plus a direction key, or a double tap), the debug
  keys F5 / F6 / F7 fill the SHORT bar, start the short, refill her, a full SHORT bar holds until a short or
  a drug (CANON rule), and during a short she can move (8 s, same damage per shock, half her HP). Next: step 4 in
  `03_GAME_DESIGN.md` §7 (the look test: one room greyboxed, then dressed two ways, for Bruno's pick).

## Rules

1. Unity 6000.3.15f1 (installed at `/home/pc/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.3.15f1`). Start it only through `tools/unity.sh`
   (RAM gate, one batch slot shared with Warspite, run folders in `runs/`). One batch Unity at a time. Close the
   editor before a batch run.
2. `.megaignore` keeps Library, Temp, Logs, UserSettings, builds, `runs/` and the vendor folders out of MEGA. Keep
   it. Renders and captures go in `~/glorified-body-renders/game/`.
3. Keyboard and mouse only for now. Render pipeline: URP. Input: the legacy Input Manager with the KeyCode remapper.
4. Packages (Bruno, 2026-10-20): Invector Shooter + FSM AI templates and Gore System URP (That Individual), imported
   from `~/.local/share/unity3d/Asset Store-5.x/` with `tools/unity.sh import`, plus Warspite2's gore and Invector
   bridge folders. PUBLIC REPO: the paid packages and `MiddlewareForInvectorTemplate` never enter git (see
   `.gitignore`). Check `git ls-files` before a commit. Never commit secrets. Push only when Bruno says so.
   A headless import does not add Invector's scripting defines: `ProjectSettings.asset` carries
   `INVECTOR_BASIC;INVECTOR_MELEE;INVECTOR_SHOOTER;INVECTOR_AI_TEMPLATE;MIS;MIS_FSM_AI` for Standalone.
5. Every mechanic has a play-mode test in the training room that runs in batch mode (`tools/unity.sh test playmode`).
   The bot (`tools/unity.sh play TrainingRoom Main_Menu structural 300`) proves the whole loop and saves shots.
6. Scenes and data assets come from editor code (`MenuLoopSetup`, `CreateDifficultyModules`), never from hand-edited
   YAML. Game code lives in `Assets/_Game/Scripts/<Subsystem>/`, namespace `GlorifiedBody.<Subsystem>`. Only
   `GlorifiedBody.Integration.Invector` may `using Invector.*`. No asmdefs (the vendor code has none).
7. Writing style for anything Bruno reads: ASD-STE100.
8. Every step ends with a note in `devlog-notes/` and the shots Bruno can open, checked at full size first.
